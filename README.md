# **Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the risk of diabetes at an early stage.
Using a dataset containing information on signs and symptoms of newly diagnosed or at-risk diabetes patients, we implement and compare two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

The dataset includes 520 rows of data with 17 features, covering various aspects such as age, gender, and symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, and sudden weight loss. We perform data preparation steps including encoding categorical variables, removing outliers, and scaling numerical features. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The analysis shows that the Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression in predicting early-stage diabetes risk. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in early disease detection and risk assessment. By enabling early intervention and personalized care, such models could significantly contribute to reducing the prevalence and complications of diabetes.

This project is for Dicoding ML Terapan courses for the first submission
